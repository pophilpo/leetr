# Leetr

A CLI tool for setting up local LeetCode projects.

# Installation
Currently, there is no convenient way to install this tool via package managers. You need to build it from the source and copy the binary to your `bin` directory.

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pophilpo/leetr

# Navigate into the project directory
cd leetr

# Build the project in release mode
cargo build --release

# Copy the binary to your bin directory (adjust the path if necessary)
sudo cp target/release/leetr /usr/local/bin
```

# Usage

To use leetr, pass the URL of the LeetCode problem and the language of your choice (python/rust) to the tool. Note that the "description" part of the URL is mandatory as it is always present when opening the problem. 

This command generates a Python 3 project with the following structure:
- A `README.md` file describing the problem.
- A `main.py` file containing the initial problem code
```sh
leetr https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description python
```

This command generates a Rust project with the following structure:
- A `README.md` file describing the problem.
- A `main.rs` file containing the initial problem code
```sh
leetr https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description rust
```

Using `leetr` without the language argument will generate a rust project by default
```sh
leetr https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description
```
