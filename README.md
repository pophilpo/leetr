# String To Integer Atoi

Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1. **Whitespace**: Ignore any leading whitespace (`" "`).
2. **Signedness**: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is `'-'` or `'+'`, assuming positivity is neither present.
3. **Conversion**: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
4. **Rounding**: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1]`, then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-2<sup>31</sup>` should be rounded to `-2<sup>31</sup>`, and integers greater than `2<sup>31</sup> - 1` should be rounded to `2<sup>31</sup> - 1`.

Return the integer as the final result.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "42"

**Output:** 42

**Explanation:**

```
The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^

```

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = " -042"

**Output:** -42

**Explanation:**

```
Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
               ^

```

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "1337c0d3"

**Output:** 1337

**Explanation:**

```
Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^

```

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "0-1"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

```
Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
          ^

```

**Example 5:**

**Input:** s = "words and 987"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= s.length <= 200`
* `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.
